# Day 2 — Logic and Control Flow

## Goals
- Understand boolean logic and control flow in Python
- Learn short-circuit evaluation
- Identify floating-point precision issues

## Work Done
- Implemented guard clauses using short-circuit evaluation
- Demonstrated floating-point comparison pitfalls
- Practiced truthiness checks with empty collections
- Used conditional (ternary) expressions for concise logic

## Key Learnings
- Short-circuiting prevents unsafe attribute access
- Floating-point numbers cannot always be compared directly
- Python objects have inherent truth values
- Conditional expressions evaluate to values, not control flow

## Blockers / Questions
- None
