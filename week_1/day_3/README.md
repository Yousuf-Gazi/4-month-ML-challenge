# Day 3 — Loops and Iteration

## Goals
- Understand loop control using `while` and `for`
- Learn how to manage infinite loops safely
- Practice stateful iteration patterns

## Work Done
- Implemented an infinite input loop with manual exit using `break`
- Used an accumulator variable to compute cumulative sums
- Applied `continue` to skip specific iterations
- Iterated over a string using Python’s iterator protocol

## Key Learnings
- `while True` loops require explicit and safe exit conditions
- Accumulator variables retain state across iterations
- `continue` skips only the current iteration without breaking the loop
- Strings in Python are iterable character by character

## Blockers / Questions
- None
