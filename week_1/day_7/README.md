# Day 7 — Exception Handling and Defensive Programming

## Goals

- Understand Python’s exception handling model
- Learn to handle runtime errors safely
- Practice writing defensive and predictable code

## Work Done

- Handled invalid user input using `try` / `except`
- Caught specific runtime errors like `ZeroDivisionError`
- Used multiple exception blocks to handle different failure modes
- Applied `finally` to guarantee cleanup and execution completion
- Raised custom exceptions to enforce business rules

## Key Learnings

- Exceptions prevent programs from crashing unexpectedly
- Specific exception handling is safer than generic catches
- `finally` always executes, regardless of success or failure
- Raising exceptions is a valid way to enforce constraints
- Defensive programming improves robustness and debuggability
